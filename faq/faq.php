            <p class="Justified"><strong><font color="#DFA800">Who can lease?</font></strong> 
              <br>
              Any company, organization or partnership. Eight out of ten American 
              companies lease equipment.<br>
              Who owns the leased equipment? <br>
              Lease One Financial Corporation, as the lessor, is the owner.</p>
            <p class="Justified">&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">What is the process for leasing equipment?</font></strong> 
              <br>
              Lease One reviews the credit information supplied. Upon approval, 
              the lease agreement is prepared by Lease One. When the equipment is 
              delivered, Lease One pays the dealer and begins billing the lessee 
              for the agreed upon lease payments.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>            
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">Is a down payment required? </font></strong><br>
              A security deposit, usually equal to one or two months' lease payment, 
              is generally needed. This differs from a down payment in that the 
              amount is typically much smaller and it is a true deposit which 
              can be applied to the purchase price of the equipment at lease-end, 
              or returned if there are no other payments due.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">How are lease payments determined?</font></strong><br>
              The monthly payment is based on the term of the lease, credit standing 
              of the lessee, cost of the equipment, and the type of leasing plan 
              the lessee chooses. The initial term of a lease usually runs from 
              36 to 60 months.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">What are factors used to determine 
              credit worthiness?</font></strong><br>
              Type of business, length of time in business, financial condition 
              as indicated by the lessee's financial statements, references from 
              financial institutions, and D. &amp; B. or other credit bureau ratings.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">Can the lease be canceled?</font></strong> 
              <br>
              Usually no, but equipment can be traded in for new, leased equipment 
              before the expiration of the initial term.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">Can equipment be purchased at the 
              end of the lease?</font></strong><br>
              Yes. The lessee has the option of continuing to lease, purchasing 
              the equipment, or returning it to Lease One. At lease end, Lease One 
              will also offer to finance the purchase price of the equipment for 
              the lessee's convenience.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">Who should sign the lease?</font></strong> 
              <br>
              The lease should be signed by an authorized officer of a corporation, 
              by one of the partners of a partnership, or by the owner of a sole 
              proprietorship.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">Who services or maintains the equipment?</font> 
              </strong><br>
              The lessee receives the benefit of all &quot;buyer&quot; warranties 
              and is responsible for the cost (if any) of maintenance. The equipment 
              vendor usually performs the maintenance.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">What about insurance?</font></strong> 
              <br>
              For the protection of both Lease One, as owners of the equipment, 
              and of our lessees, who need the equipment for their business operations, 
              we require that the equipment be insured.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">How does the lessee account for the 
              lease?</font></strong><br>
              The lease can be structured so that 100% of the payment is deducted 
              from income taxes. At the same time it is not recorded as a loan 
              on the balance sheet.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">What effect does leasing have on 
              the lessee's bank line of credit?</font> </strong><br>
              Established bank lines are usually unaffected and can be maintained 
              for day-to-day working capital needs.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><font color="#DFA800">Why lease? </font></strong><br>
              There are a number of advantages which make leasing an attractive 
              option for many firms. These include the fact that leasing offers 
              fixed regular payments (not floating), provides financing for 100% 
              of the equipment cost, allows businesses to pay for equipment as 
              it is used to generate income, conserves both working capital and 
              lines of bank credit and may offer certain tax advantages<br>
